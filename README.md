FireWars

FireWars was my first-ever game, and I'm proud to finally be releasing it into the open-source community!

It's a game about defeinding against aliens in outer space, before they hit the bottom of the screen.

Features:
little green aliens
sound effects
coins
power-ups
negative power-ups
state-based rendering/ticking
negative status effects follow you around

I ended up creating a new version of this game once I learned how badly I coded this one, so please send your pull requests to
