<h1>FireWars</h1>
<p>
FireWars was my first-ever game, and I'm proud to finally be releasing it into the open-source community!
<br>
<br>
It's a game about defeinding against aliens in outer space, before they hit the bottom of the screen.
</p>
Features:
<ul>
<li>little green aliens</li>
<li>sound effects</li>
<li>coins</li>
<li>power-ups</li>
<li>negative power-ups</li>
<li>state-based rendering/ticking</li>
<li>negative status effects follow you around</li>
<p>
I ended up creating a new version of this game once I learned how badly I coded this one, so please send your pull requests to
